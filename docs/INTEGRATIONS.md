# Integrations

External services and data pipelines: YouTube video embeds, Google Gemini
(AI news + corps avatars), and the historical-data importers that feed scoring
and schedule generation.

---

## YouTube (video embeds)

Lets the app surface relevant performance videos via the YouTube Data API v3,
with a Firestore cache to stay well under quota.

- **Backend:** `exports.searchYoutubeVideo` (`functions/src/callable/youtube.js`)
  — searches the Data API and caches results in the **`youtubeCache`**
  collection so repeat lookups don't spend quota.
- **Frontend:** `src/components/Sidebar/YouTubeModal.jsx`,
  `src/hooks/useYoutubeSearch.js`, `src/components/YouTubeIcon.jsx`. Wired into
  `Landing.jsx` and `Article.jsx`.
- **Config:** requires a YouTube Data API key in the functions environment.

## Google Gemini (AI news & media)

The game's editorial voice and corps imagery are AI-generated via Gemini.

- **News engine** — generates DCI and fantasy articles, editorials, uniform
  features, season summaries, and image prompts. Helpers:
  `functions/src/helpers/news*.js` (`newsGeneration`, `newsData`, `newsEditorial`,
  `newsFantasyArticles`, `newsDciArticles`, `newsSeasonSummary`, `newsUniforms`,
  `newsImagePrompts`, …). Triggers/automation: `functions/src/triggers/news*.js`
  and `functions/src/scheduled/newsAutoPublish.js`. Content is validated
  (`newsValidation.js`) before publish.

  > The news engine is **global/editorial** — the same feed for every director.
  > Personalized ("director as protagonist") narrative was considered and cut; do
  > not build per-user storylines on top of it. See [`GAMIFICATION.md`](GAMIFICATION.md).

- **Corps avatars** — AI-generated corps imagery via `helpers/geminiService.js`
  and `helpers/mediaService.js`, driven by the `triggers/avatarGeneration.js`
  trigger. Avatar (re)generation is currently ungated/free (Gemini free tier); if
  it moves to a paid tier, price regeneration tokens in CorpsCoin to rate-limit
  spend (a hook the economy anticipates).

- **Config:** requires a Gemini API key/secret in the functions environment.

## Historical-data importers

Two Node CLI tools under `functions/` populate the `historical_scores` corpus
that drives both **scoring** (Off-Season) and **schedule generation**
(`offSeasonDay` placement — see [`SCHEDULE_SYSTEM.md`](SCHEDULE_SYSTEM.md)). Each
follows a **harvest → parse → import** flow with `--dry-run` and year-range
flags, and keeps its own detailed README:

| Importer | Purpose | README |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **pressboxImporter** | "From The Pressbox" historical recaps — scores & rankings (2000–2025) | [`functions/pressboxImporter/README.md`](../functions/pressboxImporter/README.md) |
| **dciArchiveImporter** | archive.org event-name enrichment — show titles (2000–2012) | [`functions/dciArchiveImporter/README.md`](../functions/dciArchiveImporter/README.md) |

Both can be run against Firestore (`--firestore` / `--merge` / `--replace`) and
are invoked in CI via the `run_historical_import` path in
`.github/workflows/deploy-functions.yml`. The importer parse schema mirrors
`functions/src/triggers/scoreProcessing.js` — keep them in sync.

Related operational data (venues for the running-order model) is refreshed by the
`.github/workflows/refresh-venue-gazetteer.yml` workflow.
